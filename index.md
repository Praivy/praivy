Privacy Policy

PraivyGMA â€“ Any Games which you playing or played
For the most part, privacy policy these days is usually a long and complicated legal document. For us, it is VERY simple. That is because apps are our business, your data is NOT.
 
We will NEVER use your data for any purposes
We will NEVER share your data with any 3rd party
Your email and password are used ONLY for identification and authentication. We will NEVER send you emails (we will respond to any emails you may send us though)
We also use Unity Ads or any sdk  for advertisements in our applications. Remember, though, there could be errors in the programming, and sometime programming errors may cause unwanted side effects.
Have a question on something not covered here, please shoot us an email to  praivy@yandex.ru
